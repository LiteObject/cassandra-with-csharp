# Apache Cassandra with C#
>Cassandra is an open-source, NoSQL database that manages large amounts of data across multiple servers. It is designed to be highly available, meaning it can continue to function even if some of its nodes fail. Cassandra is decentralized and scalable, and it provides high availability without a single point of failure.

## Cassandra vs MongoDB
>MongoDB is a document store database that works with collections containing multiple documents, whereas Cassandra is a column-oriented database.

>MongoDB has a master-slave architecture, while Cassandra has a peer-to-peer architecture where all are master nodes in communication with each other.
